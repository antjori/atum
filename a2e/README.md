Angular2Elastic project.
========================

The aim of this project is to create a communication example between a front-end form and a NoSQL database.

For that, we're using [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) on the front-end, a Java REST API on the back-end and [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/) (formerly known as ElasticSearch) as our NoSQL database.
